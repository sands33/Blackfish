          <p id="headline">What We Value</p> 
          
          <p id="first">Blackfish is the name used by indigenous Coast Salish people of the Pacific Northwest for the Orca &lpar;commonly referred to as the killer whale, a misnomer for these highly intelligent mammals in the dolphin family&rpar; who have never injured a human being outside of captivity. Orca represents much of what we at Blackfish SUP value, including:</p>
          
          <p id="headline">Mindfulness:</p>
          <p id="first">The fast pace at which we live our lives in modern North American society leaves us little space to slow down and be present to the moment we are in. Paddling offers an intentional time to step out of the race of days, to gently release the concerns of the past and future and simply be here now, on the water, in this place.
</p>
          <p id="headline">Relationship:</p>
          <p id="first">Orca is known for its nuanced sense of feeling resulting from its highly developed limbic system &lpar;the part of the brain that processes emotions&rpar; which has evolved further than its human counterpart. Neuroscientists have concluded that Orcas get their sense of self from the pod, from the collective, rather than as individuals, exhibiting a very sophisticated sense of social cohesion. Blackfish SUP places value on relationship with each other and the natural world around us. We are here for each other.
</p>
          <p id="headline">Connection:</p>
          <p id="first">Our goal is to offer our clients an experience of the water that goes beyond just paddling. Whether it&apos;s on a stand up paddleboard or surfboard or a boat out at sea, being on the water is about connecting to yourself and the natural world. Our desire is to nurture this connection to the water by way of paddling.
</p>
            
          <p id="headline">Health:</p>
          <p id="first">Though the days are over when doctors prescribed days at the beach to cure what ails you, recent research backs up what people of the sea have intuitively sensed for ages: water, especially salt water, has a therapeutic effect on the bodymind, positively affecting biochemistry, relieving stress and strengthening cellular immunity. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the world&apos;s oceans, covering 70% of the earth&apos;s surface, contains the same salinity as human blood. We do indeed belong to the sea. In addition to all that, SUP is great for increasing cardiovascular health, building muscle, burning fat, and improving balance all while having fun. And anyone&ndash;ANYONE&ndash;can do it!
