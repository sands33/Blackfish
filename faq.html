         <p id="question">I have bad balance. Can I still successfully paddle a SUP?</p>
         <ul class="optionsBulletNone">
             <li id="first">YES! The boards we use are stable and very beginner friendly. And falling in is the most fun part anyway! So give it a whirl, you will not be disappointed.</li>
         </ul>
         </div>
         
         <div id= "lessonsMenu">
         <p id="question">My abs are not that strong and I have heard SUP is all about the abs. Can I still learn to SUP?</p>
         <ul class="optionsBulletNone">
             <li id="first">For sure! All the talk about needing stand up paddleboarding and abdominal strength comes from the fact that once you are at an intermediate level, engaging the core is a key part of the technique, resulting in strengthening of the core. But, you do not need abs of steel to learn how to SUP!</li>
         </ul>

         <div id= "lessonsMenu">
         <p id="question">I tried SUPing in Hawaii. Isn&rsquo;t it too cold for SUPing in Washington?</p>
         <ul class="optionsBulletNone">
             <li id="first">Not with the right gear. We paddle all year round, whether it is a sultry 85 degree day in July or a frigid 20 degree day in January. The proper gear makes all the difference, and we have everything you need, including wetsuits, booties, gloves, etc.</li>

             <li id="first">Yes. Please send us an email with your request and we will see how to best accommodate your wish.

         <p id="question"> I have tried SUP once or twice before. Do I need a lesson?
</p>
         <ul class="optionsBulletNone">
             <li id="first">Anyone can hop on a board and go have fun, but learning the proper technique will allow you to be more efficient, go faster and further, and have more fun. The ancient Polynesian watermen perfected the technique which has been passed down generation after generation. This is what we will teach you. </li>

         <ul class="optionsBulletNone">
             <li id="first">Yes. If you are a proficient at stand up paddleboarding, let us know. We will talk with you individually and work out a plan that suits your needs. </li>

         <p id="question">Can I take lessons with my kids? </p>
         <ul class="optionsBulletNone">
             <li id="first">Yes. We recommend children be at least 10 years old, depending on height and weight. Please contact us with details and we can go from there! </li>
